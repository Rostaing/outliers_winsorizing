**1. Importing necessary libraries:**

- **numpy:** For numerical computations and array manipulation.
- **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis of tabular data.
- **matplotlib.pyplot:** For creating plots.
- **seaborn:** For advanced data visualizations.

**2. Loading the data:**

- The code reads a CSV file named "data_cars.csv" and loads it into a Pandas DataFrame named "df".

**3. Initial data exploration:**

- **df.head():** Displays the first few rows of the DataFrame to get an overview of the data.
- **df.info():** Provides information about the DataFrame columns, including their data types and the presence of missing values.
- **df.shape:** Shows the number of rows and columns in the DataFrame.

**4. Visualizing the distributions of numerical variables:**

- The code iterates through all numerical columns in the DataFrame and creates a boxplot for each one using Seaborn. Boxplots allow visualizing the distribution of values, the presence of outliers, and the central tendency.

**5. Handling outliers:**

- The code iterates again through the numerical columns and applies the `clip()` method to limit extreme values to specific quantiles (10th and 90th percentiles in this case). This reduces the impact of outliers on subsequent analysis.

**6. Re-visualizing the distributions after treatment:**

- The code recreates the boxplots for the numerical columns to visualize the effect of outlier treatment.

**7. Checking the DataFrame structure after treatment:**

- **df.shape:** Displays again the number of rows and columns to ensure that the treatment did not modify the DataFrame structure.
- **df.head():** Displays again the first few rows to observe the changes made to the values.
- **df.tail():** Displays the last rows of the DataFrame for additional verification.

**In summary, this Python code performs the following steps:**

1. Loads a car dataset from a CSV file.
2. Explores the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
3. Visualizes the distributions of numerical variables using boxplots.
4. Handles outliers by limiting them to specific quantiles.
5. Re-visualizes the post-treatment distributions to verify the effect.
6. Checks the DataFrame structure after treatment.
